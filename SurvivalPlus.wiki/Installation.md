### **INSTALLATION**
***

Installation of **SurvivalPlus** is quite simple.

### **Installing the Plugin**
***

First, throw the SurvivalPlus.jar into your server's plugin folder, start your server and let it generate the appropriate files. It is best to install this plugin on a fresh new server. If you install it on a current running server, players may have already acquired items and/or resources that may affect the gameplay of this plugin.

### **Setting Up the Config**
***

After you have installed the plugin you can open up the [config.yml](https://github.com/skypixel-development/SurvivalPlus/wiki/Config#default-config) and configure it to your liking. Here you can enable/disable certain gameplay mechanics and recipes. Make sure to give a good read thru of the [config wiki](https://github.com/skypixel-development/SurvivalPlus/wiki/Config) to make sure you have the best understanding of what everything means.

SPECIAL NOTE:
* It is best practice to set your config up once and not change it later. Due to how a lot of mechanics work, its best to have this all set up from the get go rather than changing things throughout the life of your server.

### **Changing the Lang File**
***

You can also open up the lang_EN.yml and change up any of the messages to suit your servers needs.

This file also includes names and lores for most of the custom items in the game.

### **Loot Tables**
***

I highly recommend editing the [loot tables](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table) of your server. Loot tables are files that contain the possible items that generate in chests in structures such as villages, underwater ruins, mineshaft, jungle/desert temples, etc, as well as what items mobs drop. I recommend removing things from loot tables that are removed in this plugin (ie: wooden/golden tools). You can find plugins that will change loot tables or you can manually edit the files yourself. I will hopefully include a proper wiki soon on how to do that. For now, check out the [Minecraft Wiki's Loot Table](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table) page for more info.

### **Last Steps**
***

The last step is to assign the correct [permissions](https://github.com/skypixel-development/SurvivalPlus/wiki/Commands#permissions) to anyone on your server. There's really not a lot of permissions to deal with, and your players will not require any special permissions to play.

### **Finale**
***

After all of this, you should be good to go with SurvivalPlus
