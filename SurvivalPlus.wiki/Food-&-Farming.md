## **FOOD DIVERSITY**

Why should you only eat one type of food? Let's make some variations.


### **NUTRIENTS IN FOOD ARE DIVIDED INTO 3 CATEGORIES:**

* Carbohydrates
  * Mainly grains and sugars
* Proteins
  * Mainly meat, poultry, and milk
* Vitamins and Salts
  * Mainly vegetables and fruits

Eating lesser of a type of food will cause malnutrition, which will cause serious negative effects.
Remember, eat healthily!


# **FARMING**


## **HARVESTING**

You will need to use a sickle to harvest fruits and vegetables in your garden. When you use a stone sickle ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/79953b2d32af76f8c2a123009aa24524ef338b9c1b77d029264a4658d063edc8/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f39716e575530712e706e67) you will notice there's a chance that the plants won't drop any food. You can use an iron sickle ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1b776279d675bd9f941c7503239f4d598f1117f243e986d9e4ce93a16fc85c10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f315a6a676f4a482e706e67) which will have a higher chance of dropping more food.


## **BREEDING**

It's weird to have instant baby chicks when breeding Chickens.

* Chickens now lay 1-4 egg(s) instead of breeding a new chick.
* Eggs have 100% chance to hatch a chick.
