# **ADVANCED TOOLS**


## **RECURVED BOW/CROSSBOW** ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/32e6591776e76076b91444f481e23dd354acdc7085451a0c4c0088125e2ae2ce/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f3954656a6253632e706e67)

Much stronger, much more accurate, much faster!

With re-curvature, your bow fires arrow only when you fully load the bow.
However, the arrow shot will travel in a straight line.
The speed of the arrow is increased, hence its damage is higher.


## **MEDIC KIT** ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/060b510e1d2385347919893b325b8405e582e4c7a46a02514066c15bc68f8091/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f685261616d47592e706e67)

**Can be used to heal yourself or an ally; it grants full health (10 x ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d99cadf9c31239d32a47a40bf3eefa65e0dfa8bedbdf81a2281b70fb1e645525/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d724d77386d422e706e67)​) in 5 seconds.**
* To heal someone, right-click on him/her with Medic Kit.
* To heal yourself, sneak and right-click with Medic Kit.

**However, during the healing process, both of you MUST:**

* Not be hurt by anything.
* Not go too far from each other.
* The Healer must hold Medic Kit in main hand.
The Healer will be standing still while healing one, very vulnerable to surprise attacks.

To cancel healing early, switch away from the Medic Kit.
