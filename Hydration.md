## **WATER BOWL** ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a2c4eaeb758b9eaf9f5b67f2330867921408b92c627fe7eb98211700f62a2ef5/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f724745756530302e706e67)

If you are thirsty, craft a Bowl to obtain water.
Simply throw 1 Bowl into a water source, it will become a Water Bowl.
Drinking it will quench the thirst. Drinking impure water runs a 60% risk of getting poisoned for 4 seconds. Purified water is recommended when cauldrons are affordable.


## **WATER BOTTLES** ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/96fd75828a7b62d1712876cec946aaf1f25ef7728240b3ae6962886ee0784ca0/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f467143445751562e706e67)

Water Bottles can be obtained by right-clicking a glass bottle into a water source, but it's not purified and not safe to drink.

Drinking impure water has high chance to get Poison for 4 seconds.

To get rid of that risk, you can either clean your water or purify it:

### **CLEAN WATER:**

Clean water will have a medium risk of getting poisoned. There's a couple of ways to get clean water:

1. Throw a dirty water bottle on the campfire:

2. Throw a dirty water bottle in a furnace or smoker:

To clean water this way will take longer than most cooking recipes.

### **PURIFIED WATER** 

Purified water is the cleanest water you can get. It will have no negative side effects and it will replenish your thirst meter a lot quicker.

1. Make a Cauldron and prepare a fuel block.
2. Light the Cauldron with fire.
3. Fill the Cauldron with water.

4. Fill the glass bottles with this purified water.

## **COFFEE:** ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2cde5aab82f5993e6b715520d5b07b3b15a816fda6c9db0ae7b796f852508ad8/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f34586667337a352e706e67)

Players can craft coffee in their crafting table.
When drank, it will increase their thirst level by 23 points, and will also refresh their energy level.


## **EMPTYING CONTAINERS**

Simply throw a water bottle, water bowl or potion in your workbench, and you will get back an empty bottle/bowl.
